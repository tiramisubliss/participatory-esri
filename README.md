# Participatory Planning

An interactive 3D web application enabling citizens to engage in urban planning, using the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/). This is a non-commercial demo application made by the Esri R&D Center Zurich. It is intended for presentations or as a starting point for new projects.

The app uses various API features such as [3D drawing](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-widgets-Sketch.html), [glTF import](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/import-gltf/index.html) and [client-side filtering](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-layers-support-FeatureFilter.html). The example scene used in the app is located in Dumbo, Brooklyn NY.

On the technical side the app is built using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).
